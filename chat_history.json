Here's a summary:\n* Match score: 0%\n* Strengths: None relevant to the SDE role\n* Weaknesses: Lack of relevant education (Marketing instead of Computer Science), no experience in software development, and no relevant technical skills\n* Recommendations: Unfortunately, Alex's background is not suitable for the SDE position. He may be a good fit for marketing or sales roles, but not for a technical position like SDE.\n\n**Resume 2: Jane Smith_Resume.pdf**\nNow, let's look at Jane's resume. Here's how it matches the SDE job requirements:\n* Match score: 90%\n* Strengths: Relevant education (Bachelor's in Computer Science), experience in software development (SDE at XYZ Tech), proficiency in Java, Spring, and algorithms, and familiarity with AWS, microservices, and Git\n* Weaknesses: No mention of experience with Python, C++, or NoSQL databases, but these are not essential requirements\n* Recommendations: Jane's resume is a strong match for the SDE role. She has the required education, relevant experience, and a good set of technical skills. I recommend moving her to the next round of the hiring process.\n\nRanking the resumes, I would place Jane Smith's resume as the top candidate, and unfortunately, Alex Johnson's resume does not meet the requirements for the SDE position.",
